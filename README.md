## 🎯AIM
Goal of this program was to train a neural network model through **_genetic algorithm_**
in **_gym environment API_** provided by OpenAI. Main goal of this task force to design an 
efficient crossover method and mutation method. Then we had to **_show the fitness graph_**
over generations.
## 👨‍💻LANGUAGE

## 📚LIBRARIES USED
- gym 
- NumPy  
- matplotlib 
- random
## ⚙️INSTRUCTIONS
Only instruction to run this file is if the graph is not optimal, stuck in local maxima, that is 
does not achieve a good maximum (say 180) then you can run this code again and that 
should solve the problem. This is due to the **_entire random structure of the algorithm_** overall.
